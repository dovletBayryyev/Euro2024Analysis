Exploring the relationship between squad age and squad performance in the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament

## 1. Goal
The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between squad age and squad performance in the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament.

## 2. Dataset
There are 2 datasets used in this analysis.
1. euro2024_standings --> this dataset has the rankings of each team in the tournament based on how far the team got in the tournament.
2. player_playing_time --> this dataset has each player's age, squad, and minutes played

## 3. Statistical Method used
In this analysis linear regression was used to find the relationship between squad age and squad performance.

## 4. Technology 
The technology used here is a python notebook with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.

## 5. Conclusion
The Correlation Coefficient r = 0.03 is very close to 0 meaning that there is a weak positive relationship between squad age ans squad performance in the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament. This weak correlation indicates that the relationship is not statistically significant and the pattern is negligible.
